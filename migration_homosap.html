	<h1>Homo sapiens and early human migration</h1>

	<h3>Homo sapiens, the first modern humans, evolved from their early hominid predecessors<br> between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago.<br> They developed a capacity for language about 50,000 years ago.<br>
The first modern humans began moving outside of Africa starting about 70,000-100,000 years ago.<br>
Humans are the only known species to have successfully populated,<br> adapted to, and significantly altered a wide variety of land regions across the world,<br> resulting in profound historical and environmental impacts.</h3>

<h1>Where do we begin?</h1>

<h3>Before we tell the stories that make up world history,<br> it is useful to ask: where do we begin? Where did our human stories start?</h3>

<h3>Homo sapiens is part of a group called hominids, which were the earliest humanlike creatures. Based <br>archaeological and anthropological evidence, we think that hominids diverged from other primates somewhere <br>between 2.5 and 4 million years ago in eastern and southern Africa. Though there was a degree of diversity among ><br>the hominid family, they all shared the trait of bipedalism, or the ability to walk upright on two legs.
</h3>

<h1>Evolution</h1>

<h3>Scientists have several theories about why early hominids evolved. One, the aridity hypothesis, suggests that <br>early hominids were more suited to dry climates and evolved as the Africa’s dry savannah regions expanded.</h3>

<h3>According to the savannah hypothesis, early tree-dwelling hominids may have been pushed out of their homes as<br>environmental changes caused the forest regions to shrink and the size of the savannah expand.<br> These changes, according to the savannah hypothesis,<br> may have caused them to adapt to living on the ground and walking upright instead of climbing.</h3>

<h3>Hominids continued to evolve and develop unique characteristics. Their brain capacities increased,<br><br> and approximately 2.3 million years ago,<br><br> a hominid known as Homo habilis began to make and use simple tools. By a million years ago,<br><br> some hominid species, particularly Homo erectus, began to migrate out of Africa and into Eurasia,<br><br> where they began to make other advances like controlling fire.</h3>

<h3>Though there were once many kinds of hominids, only one remains: Homo sapiens. Extinction is a normal part of<br> evolution, and scientists continue to theorize why other hominid species didn’t survive. We do have some clues as to why some<br> species were less successful at surviving than others, such as an inability to cope with competition for food,<br> changes in climate, and volcanic eruptions.</h3>

<h1>Migration and the Peopling of the Earth</h1>

<h2>How and Why?</h2>
<h3>Between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago, Homo sapiens began migrating from the African continent and populating <br>parts of Europe and Asia. They reached the Australian continent in canoes sometime between 35,000 and 65,000 years ago.</h3>
<br><br><br>
<h3>Scientists studying land masses and climate know that the Pleistocene Ice Age created a land bridge that <br>connected Asia and North America (Alaska) over 13,000 years ago.<br><br> A widely accepted migration theory is that people crossed this land bridge and eventually migrated into North and South America.</h3>

<br><br><br>

<h3>How were our ancestors able to achieve this feat, and why did they make the decision to leave their homes?<br> The development of language around 50,000 years ago allowed people to make plans,<br> solve problems, and organize effectively. We can’t be sure of the exact reasons humans<br> first migrated off of the African continent, but it was likely correlated with a depletion of resources (like food)<br> in their regions and competition for those resources.<br> Once humans were able to communicate these concerns and make plans, they could assess together whether the pressures<br> in their current home outweighed the risk of leaving to find a new one.</h3>

<h2>Spread of Homo sapiens.</h2>

<h1>Adaptation and effects on nature</h1>

<h3>When humans migrated from Africa to colder climates, they made clothing out of animal skins and constructed <br>fires to keep themselves warm; often, they burned fires continuously through the winter.<br>Sophisticated weapons, such as spears and bows and arrows, allowed them to kill large mammals efficiently.<br> Along with changing climates, these hunting methods contributed<br> to the extinction of giant land mammals such as mammoths, giant kangaroos, and mastodons.<br> Fewer giant mammals, in turn, limited hunters’ available prey.</h3>

<br>

<h3>In addition to hunting animals and killing them out of self-defense, humans began to use the earth’s<br>\resources in new ways when they constructed semi-permanent settlements.<br> Humans started shifting from nomadic lifestyles to fixed homes,<br> using the natural resources there. Semi-permanent settlements would be the building-blocks<br> of established communities and the development of agricultural practices.</h3>
