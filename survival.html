	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Survival Of Humans During Evolution
</h1>
<br>
	<h1>The human lineage was not always at the top of the food chain. Our ancestors met astonishing challenges in their surroundings, and were susceptible to disease, injury, and predators. Environmental change – one of the ongoing challenges to survival – created both risks and opportunities in the lives of early humans. The period of human evolution was one of the most dramatic eras of climate instability in Earth’s history. In every generation, early humans faced the problem of how best to endure in their immediate surroundings. Yet over time, the line between thriving and extinction was defined by how best to adjust to the uncertainties of climate shifts between rainy and arid, glacial and warm.<br><br><br>  

The living world is a display of astonishing adaptations. These adaptations embrace all the structures and behaviors that have favored the survival and reproduction of organisms in the times and places in which they evolved. Our species, Homo sapiens, is recent on the evolutionary scene, having first appeared only about 200,000 years ago. Although all earlier hominids are now extinct, many of their adaptations for survival—an appetite for a varied diet, making tools to gather food, caring for each other, and using fire for heat and cooking—make up the foundation of our modern survival mechanisms and are among the defining characteristics of our species. <br><br><br>

A species depends not only on the particular way of life that best matches its surroundings but also on keeping certain options open and adjusting to whatever trials or opportunities occur as things change. The process of evolution not only shapes adaptations to specific habitats but also shapes ways of life that confer a certain degree of adaptability. Since individual species may persist for hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions, of years, the capacity to adjust to novel situations is an important outcome of evolution, offering resilience and an ability to recover from difficult times.<br><br><br>

Some examples of the survival evolution:
<br><br>
1. Throwing stones and using weapons were important additions to self and group defense. There is also clear evidence that by about 800,000 years ago some hominids had controlled fire and built well-defined hearths. Most animals have an innate fear of fire and would be likely to have kept their distance from a campfire. The light from the campfire would also have helped our ancestors avoid surprise attacks. Between 800,000 and 400,000 years ago, we see strong evidence for building both shelters and hearths, the level of human social cooperation had reached a crucial milestone.<br><br><br>

2. Possibly the ultimate evidence that social support had become an essential part of the human survival package is purposeful burial. Instead of leaving the dead where they lay, Neanderthals and modern humans buried their dead. It could be argued that this was simply a sanitary measure, but there is evidence that suggests far more was going on. We can see this at Shanidar Cave, where an adult male Neanderthal was carefully placed on his side in a shallow grave in a fetal position. There is good evidence that colorful flowers and evergreen boughs were intentionally placed in the burial with him.  <br><br><br>

3. Early humans were adapted to the African savanna. Walking upright on two legs and making implements were critical to the survival of ancestors who ventured onto the dry, dangerous plains. As grasslands spread, hunting and eating meat proved advantageous. The control of fire staved off predators. With the expansion of early humans into Asia and Europe, the challenges of the Ice Age helped hone the capacity for social cooperation. Speaking to one another helped pass on the traditions of toolmaking. Eventually, language allowed technological innovations to catch on and creative endeavors, including art, to blossom. All the way back to the earliest bipedal predecessors, one survival skill led to another, which spurred on still newer adaptations—all against the backdrop of the arid equatorial savanna and the frigid northern landscape.

The survival conditions of human evolution were continually revised as climate oscillated between arid and moist and between cold and warm. Scientists now speak of the environments of human evolution, with emphasis on variability and they consider the instability of environments, not merely the expansion of grasslands or glaciers, as having shaped the evolved characteristics of human beings. <br><br><br>
