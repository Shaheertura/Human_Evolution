</h1>
<br>
	<h1>

If we define culture as "information capable of affecting individuals' behavior that they acquire from other members of their species through teaching, imitation and other forms of social transmission,” cultural evolution is fundamentally just the change of culture over time.
The core idea of cultural evolution is that cultural change––that is, changes in socially transmitted beliefs, knowledge, customs, skills, attitudes, languages, and so on––can be described as a Darwinian evolutionary process that is similar in key respects (but not identical) to biological/genetic evolution. More specifically, just as Darwin described biological/genetic evolution as comprising three key components––variation, competition (or selection), and inheritance––cultural change also comprises these same phenomena. Yet while cultural evolution can be described as Darwinian in this sense, the details of the processes (e.g., how variation is generated, or how information is transmitted) are likely to be different in the cultural case compared to the details of biological/genetic evolution.<br><br><br>  

Cultural Evolution is any learnt behaviour (knowledge, attitudes, customs and ideas) passed from one generation to the next by learning. We often associate culture with the tools and artifacts early hominids produce and traditionally can be  divided into Stone, Bronze and Iron ages, according to the main materials used. The Stone age can be further broken down into the following periods:<br><br><br>

Lower Paleolithic 3 million years ago
<br><br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Earliest Stone tools introduced by Homo habilis</li><br>

<li>Began with Oldowan tool industry, utilizing stone flakes and cores</li><br>

<li>Further development led to the Acheulian tool industry, utilizing the more advanced handaxe (H. erectus)</li></ul><br>

Middle Paleolithic 120,000 years ago
<br><br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>More advanced tools, made from a greater variety of materials. First widely used by Homo neanderthalensis</li><br>

<li>The middle Paleolithic is characterized by the Mousterian tool industry, whereby flint was often shaped using the Levallois technique, giving extremely sharp edges.</li></ul><br><br>

Upper Paleolithic 35,000 years ago
<br><br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Tools displaying a much more sophisticated design and greater ingenuity. Associated with the earliest anatomically modern ‘Cro-Magnon’ Homo sapiens</li><br>

<li>Tools included throwing sticks, harpoons and much finer blades and spearheads made using ‘punch blade’ technique</li><br>

<li>Culture also included cave paintings and sculptures.</li></ul><br><br>

Mesolithic 12,000 years ago
<br><br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Increased use of smaller finer tools and blades. Often small stone tools / blades (microliths) were incorporated into wooden or bone tools.</li><br>

<li>These tools were exclusively used by Homo sapiens
Commodities used to make these tools (stone, bone, antler, hides, etc) would have been traded.</li></ul><br><br>

Neolithic 10,000 years ago
<br><br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Neolithic culture is characterized by the development of agriculture. Wheat, corn, potatoes and rice were amongst the first ever domesticated crops.</li><br>


<li>These crops would provide an excess that could be traded and represent a shift away from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle and toward a market economy. This in turn would allow for greater population densities and the division of labour.</li></ul><br><br>

Cultural and biological evolution have influenced each other. Selection for
a bipedal lifestyle (biological evolution) freed up the hands making later cultural developments possible. Likewise, the development of early tools (cultural evolution) resulted in an improved diet, which in turn allowed for the selection (biological evolution) of a larger brain. This in turn aided the further development of tools and so on and so forth. Cultural and biological evolution have fuelled each-other resulting in the fairly rapid evolution of Humans with large brains and sophisticated technologies.
